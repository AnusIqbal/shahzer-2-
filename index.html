                        We've accumulated nearly all of the world's knowledge online, but we forget how much of that
                        data is personal. Today's Web is dominated by Hooli and a handful of other tech companies that
                        have built their fortunes tracking massive amounts of our data — photos, status updates,
                        location check-ins, web cookies, and more.

                    So the question becomes: What do these tech companies do with all of this personal information? So
                    as not to violate several NDAs I was forced to sign upon my exit from Hooli, I can only speak
                    generally: It’s not pretty. They exploit your online activity and preferences for profit. They sell
                    your data to advertisers. You become the product.
                </h3>
                <p>That’s why we at Pied Piper are building a decentralized internet — one which takes power from these
                    megacorporations and gives it back to you, the netizens.</p>

        </a>
        <p>Hello, readers! I apologize for not posting for a couple of months — we had quite a grim stretch here at Fort Piper. Our user growth had stalled and morale was low. But just as we were about to give up hope, Dinesh discovered an uptick in new users! Things seemed to be trending up,…</p>

            <p>The old Pied Piper “flute player” logo was referencing the fairy-tale character and in no way was meant to suggest a sexual act involving either the mouth or ear of the figure depicted. Apologies to any who were offended, and the logo has been changed to our current hat design by Mary Shibley that's clean, elegant and not without some danger.</p>
